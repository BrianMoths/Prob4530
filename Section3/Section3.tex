\maketitle

For a discrete random variable $X$, we define the probability mass function (pmf) by the equation
\[
p(x) = \text{Pr}(X=x)\,.
\]
A probability mass function gives the probability that a discrete random variable is exactly equal to some value. \vspace{.25cm}

The moment generating function of a discrete random variable $X$, denoted by $M_{X}(t)$, is defined as
\[  
M_{X}(t) = E( e^{tX} ) = \sum_{x} e^{tx}p(x) \,,
\]
provided that the expectation exists for $t$ in some neighborhood of $0$. \vspace{.25cm}

 The probability generating function for a discrete random variable $X$ taking values in the non-negative integers, denoted by $G_{X}(z)$, is defined as
 \[
 G_{X}(z) = E(z^{X}) = \sum_{x=0}^{\infty} z^{x}p(x) \,.
 \]
 
We have the following identities
\begin{align*}
E(X^{k}) &= M^{(k)}_{X}(0) \,,  \\
 p(k) &= \frac{G^{(k)}_{X}(0)}{k!} \,.
\end{align*}
where $k$ should be a non-negative integer and we are taking derivatives.
