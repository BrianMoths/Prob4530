\begin{question}
Suppose:

$P(\text{rain today})=40\,\%\,$; 

$P(\text{rain tomorrow})=50\,\%\,$; 

$P(\text{rain today and tomorrow})=30\,\%\,$.

Given that it rains today, what it is the chance that it will rain tomorrow ?
     \begin{solution}
           The answer is \answer{$75$} $\%$.
     \end{solution}
\end{question}

There are two urns. The first urn contains $2$ black balls and $3$ white balls. The second urn contains $4$ black balls and $3$ white balls. An urn is chosen random, and a ball is chosen at random from that urn.
     \begin{hint}
          Draw a suitable tree diagram.
     \end{hint}

\begin{question}
a) Calculate the probability that the first urn was chosen.
     \begin{solution}
           The answer is \answer{$1/2$}.
     \end{solution}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
b) Calculate the probability that the ball drawn is black given the first urn was chosen.
     \begin{solution}
           The answer is \answer{$2/5$}.
     \end{solution}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
b) Calculate the probability that the ball drawn is white given the second urn was chosen.
     \begin{solution}
           The answer is \answer{$3/7$}.
     \end{solution}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
b) Calculate the probability that the ball drawn is black.
     \begin{solution}
           The answer is \answer{$17/35$}.
     \end{solution}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
A hat contains a number of cards, with

$30\,\%$ white on both sides;

$50\,\%$ black on one side and white on the other;

$20\,\%$ black on both sides.

The cards are mixed up, then a single card is drawn at random and placed on the table. If the top side is black, what is the chance that the other side is white ?
     \begin{solution}
           The answer is \answer{$5/9$}.
     \end{solution}
\end{question}
