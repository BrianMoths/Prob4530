In a standard $52$ card deck there are $4$ suits:  spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs.  Each suit consists of $13$ different values:  $2$, $3$, ..., $10$, J, Q, K, A. 

\begin{question}
a)  How many $5$ card hands contain exactly one pair?  (two cards of the same value, and $3$ cards of $3$ different values)
     \begin{solution}
           The answer is \answer{$1098240$}.
     \end{solution}
\end{question}     

\begin{question}     
b)  How many $5$ card hands contain a three of a kind?  (three cards of the same value, and two cards of $2$ different values)
     \begin{solution}
           The answer is \answer{$54912$}.
     \end{solution}
\end{question}     

\begin{question}     
c)  How many $5$ card hands are a full house?  (a pair of one value and three of a kind of another value)
     \begin{solution}
           The answer is \answer{$3744$}.
     \end{solution}
\end{question}

What are the probabilities of each of the hands in a, b, and c from the previous question ?

\begin{question}
     \begin{solution}
           The probability of the event a is \answer{$1098240/2598960$}.
     \end{solution}
\end{question}

Suppose that you have two fair dice with $n$ sides.  The first die has faces with numbers $1, 2, ..., n$  The second die has faces with numbers $n, n+1, n+2, ..., 2n-1$.  You roll the dice.

\begin{question}
a)  Determine the probability that the sum of the faces up is $n$.
     \begin{solution}
           The answer is \answer{$0$}.
     \end{solution}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
b)  Determine the probability that the sum of the faces up is $2n$.
     \begin{solution}
           The answer is \answer{$1/n$}.
     \end{solution}
\end{question}

\begin{question}
Suppose that you and a friend play a game with the following rules:  there is a green player and a blue player,  there are $2$ green marbles and $2$ blue marbles in a hat, the players alternate drawing a marble from the hat, and a coin is tossed to determine who goes first.  To win, a player must draw their marble (the green player must draw a green marble to win), and if a player does not draw their marble, then they put the drawn marble back into the hat and add a marble of the opponents color to the hat.  Suppose that the green player has won the coin toss.  Determine the probability that the blue player wins on or before his/her second turn.
     \begin{solution}
           The answer is \answer{$5/14$}.
     \end{solution}
\end{question}
